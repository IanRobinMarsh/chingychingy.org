# Are you an expert?

Definitely not! this page is solely a set of tips gained by experience
plus input from people I know (thanks, I’ll save you the mentions
:-). So, there is no social science, psychology, marriage guidance,
however some references.

## COVID means we are all ‘distanced’

Due to distancing of people, we all need to be better at distance
relationships. Whether work or personal, we are separated and need to
embrace, albeit not literally, the distance. So, although this text is
more about couples coping with, enjoying, living with physical and
often temporal separation.

Tech. etiquette

Distance relationships necessitate tech. Most probably Internet tools
/ apps in 2020. Try to avoid text if possible, quite a lot of
arguments arise by using text, rather than speaking. People use text
to express frustration or amorous feelings, but voice and video is
better for both, lower the anger by voice / video or increase the
joy. Be mindful of the time zone differences, one sleeping, one
partying etc. (avoid mixed feelings). Let one person talk for a longer
time, than highly interactive, (better to sync like this) than very
highly interactive sessions. Try not to discuss heavy things before
one or both sleep.

(Real) time together

Try not to fight on holiday (save that for after :-)) Savour the
time. Prepare before going to keep calm. Some mins / hours apart
(exercise, shopping, etc.) always works well. A little headspace and
the feeling of being together again (specially away from both homes),
one experiences the other one not being there, (you are alone) and
then back together again.

Book next trip soon after last (look forward to something) it’s worth
of having something in the bank (well worth the money for that alone).

Spend little time apart, to appreciate good times

Multi-culti relationships

For those pairs who are not from the same country, some slightly
different aspects might be worth observing. Try to observe cultural
differences, Swedes are quiet and leave long pauses, Americans much
more, some cultures show and demonstrate emotion, whereas it is little
more tabo. Often distances can exacerbate these differences, as the
lines of communication are thinner.

When things go / are going wrong

Recognising when things are not going too well is very, very
useful. (Over). State a heads up before launching into something the
other person might not be aware of. Remember they can’t see your
expressions as well, body language etc. or even you are frustrated.

Video, talk or if texting, use emoji’s when ambiguity might start
creep in. Do have a quick look at the call logs, who called whom and
for how long. If you are in deficit try can call, it will be
appreciated by that one making (more) effort. Sometimes it can be
little things like who calls the most, or replies quicker that can be
the cause than something more fundamental (1st world problems).

what else ? don’t worry too much about tech issues, but the best
quality voice or video might be good. some said business calls needed
good quality voice, but in reality couples do.

Be clear if something is one person’s mind (don’t let it fester), that often ends up worse.

Dispersed but not ‘separated’

Have a joint distance hobby, blog, watch TV together, something joint,
but online) apart from the obvious). Immerse in one’s person’s life
for a few days (learn their style) can be useful when conversation
dries up (another de facto topic, like weather, work). Also shows
respect and others like to talk about their hobbies.

Build on trustful things, not mistrust.
