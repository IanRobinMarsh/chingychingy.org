Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You
can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of
the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit
`_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your
[publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to
use
[Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/){:target="\_blank"}
and
[Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/){:target="\_blank"},
like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google
Scholar, or just disable all of them.
