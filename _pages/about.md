Alternate work [site](https://ianmarsh.org){:target="\_blank"}.

Some random pages, ideas, projects not `related` to work.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to
use
[Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/){:target="\_blank"}
and
[Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/){:target="\_blank"},
like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google
Scholar, or just disable all of them.
